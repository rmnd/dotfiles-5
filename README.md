# Dotfiles
#### My Arch Linux dotfiles.

Here is what my current `rice` consists of, all of it's dotfiles.
* My custom GTK theme made using [Oomox](https://github.com/actionless/oomox)
* Rofi config `.Xresources`
* bspwm
* termite
* polybar
* compton
* neofetch

You are free to use my config if you credit my work.
#### Here is a preview of it in a screenshot.
